To classify these tweets we can do two steps:
- **Data Preparation**: Each text is tokenized in which each message into individual words or characters or words without StopWords such as (is, a, an etc.)

Secondly, **Data cleaning & lemmatization** helps in reducing dimensions of words such as plural and converting all texts into lowercase, thus enhancing overall clarity

We divide our total sample of tweed texts into three categories based on positive neutral

The training dataset consists primarily of tweet objects represented as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) structures containing information such as tweet content, user details, hashtags, URLs, emoji, and reactions count. We only use the textual tweet descriptions excluding unnecessary attributes.

let hashtagsFilter =

This will give us:

This solution uses JavaScript higher-order function, arrow functions in lambda form, built-in **includes** method for String instances, **join()** methods & Template Literals. 
We create a filter with **Array.prototype.filter**, the callbacks argument is an Arrow function.

Letting go of sentiment analysis in favor of a simpler approach based on positive/negative content.

    Identify words which appear  more often  (or relatively) more often   negative tweets than   posit... or no-neg ones and vice versa.

# Step 4: Perform Text Preprocessing on Tweets

Preprocess the data (text preprocessing) by removing stopwords, stemming or lemmatizing, tokenization, lower casing, and punctuation removal.

```
import re 
import nltk tokenizer # Install NLTK Data: import nltk; nltk download ('punkt','stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
from nltk.stem.porterstemmer from import Porter-Stem-

)

# Example of usage:
result = HateSpeechDetector()
preds_dict = result.infer(batch_sentences_list)
print(preds_dict)    #
```
    
The `infer` function is used with a list of texts as input, the detector will predict each text to one of seven categories ('none', 'generalized hatred', 'anti-lgbt+', 'antisemitism', 'anti-atheist', etc.), and output labels, and return confidence score for each.

In these tweets (where ""t"" stands for shortened 'that' or 'to', and ""@username"" tags a specific user), we can identify negative sentiment towards Chipotle due to their social media mishap:

1. The author implies a sense of betrayal using expressions like ""tough time to be,"" which highlights the severity of the situation.

 `tokenizer = transformers.BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')`

 

&#x20;if not data.exists(label_path):

&nbsp; &nbsp; label_set=\[] # here add list which holds labels names as strings

 &#x20;$&#x20;

   file=open(label_file,&quot;r"") &lt;br=&gt; readDataFromFile(file) \# returns read list  

2 )ReadLabels()

`data_list=get_labels_from_data(tweedpath)

`

Here get all the unique elements from a specified folder for data, each one of them will provide a new output line within file.

Then when I generate input_ids, token_type_ids and attention mask I'll be using

```python


max_lengths=tweet_max_length if hasattr(locals(), ""tweets_max_legnth"")

max_length=128 # Default if tweet maxlen doesnt exists

padding_value= max_length

attentionPaddingToken=tokens_padding[""attentionMask""]
inputs=inputIDs



```
